# Cadences: The Rhythm of Intentional Living

Personal Agent OS works through regular reflection cadences. These are not obligations—they're investments in clarity that pay compounding returns.

---

## Overview

| Cadence | Time | Frequency | Purpose |
|---------|------|-----------|---------|
| Daily | 5-10 min | Every day | Stay aligned |
| Weekly | 30-45 min | Sunday/Monday | Plan and reflect |
| Monthly | 60-90 min | First of month | Deep calibration |
| Quarterly | 2-3 hours | Every 3 months | Strategic review |
| Yearly | Half day | January | Vision refresh |

---

## Daily Cadence (5-10 minutes)

The daily check-in keeps you aligned without becoming a burden.

### Morning (2-3 minutes)

Open your weekly doc (`02_JOURNAL/Weekly/{{year}}-W{{week}}.md`) and:

1. **Check your Top 3** - What must happen today?
2. **Set intention** - How do you want to show up?
3. **Glance at your keystone** - Is today moving you toward it?

### Evening (3-5 minutes)

Before winding down:

1. **Log your energy** - Rate 1-10, note what affected it
2. **Capture notes** - What happened? What did you learn?
3. **Gratitude** - One thing you're grateful for (tag with #gratitude)
4. **Check tomorrow** - Quick glance at what's ahead

### The Daily Compass

Five questions to run through your day against:

- [ ] **Body** - Did I move?
- [ ] **Create** - Did I make something?
- [ ] **Truth** - Did I tell the truth?
- [ ] **Connect** - Did I connect with someone?
- [ ] **Awe** - Did I feel gratitude or wonder?

You don't need to hit all five daily—but if you consistently miss one, that's signal.

## Weekly Cadence (30-45 minutes)

Best done Saturday evening, Sunday, or Monday morning. **Flexible by design.** This is your most important ritual.

### Philosophy

- **Don't ask what you know** — Read the data, surface patterns, confirm accuracy
- **Project-first thinking** — Top 3s emerge from project review
- **Think bigger** — This isn't task management, it's life alignment
- **Zero entropy** — Every mentioned entity gets updated

### The Flow

```
SILENT READ → WEEK PORTRAIT → PROJECTS → TOP 3s → PILLARS → THINK BIGGER → WRITE
```

### Phase 1: Week Portrait (10 min)

Close last week with **pattern-oriented insights**, not Q&A:

- **Energy Arc** — How did energy flow across the week?
- **Pillar Heat Map** — Which pillars got attention? Which were neglected?
- **Project Distribution** — Where did focus actually go?
- **Wins & Gaps** — What shipped? What didn't?
- **Pattern** — One insight about the week's rhythm

Ask only: "Is this accurate? Anything missing?"

### Phase 2: Project-by-Project (10 min)

For each active project:
1. Surface what happened last week (from data)
2. Ask: "What MUST happen this week?"
3. Ask: "What would feel like a win?"

Then: "Any projects to add, pause, or deprioritize?"

### Phase 3: Top 3s (5 min)

**Top 3s emerge from the project review:**
- Synthesize professional priorities from project deliverables
- Connect personal priorities to pillar gaps and monthly focus

### Phase 4: Pillar Commitments (5 min)

Don't walk through all 10. **Focus on gaps:**
- Show last week's scores and trends
- Highlight weak pillars (below 5)
- Ask for specific, measurable commitments on weak areas
- Acknowledge what's working

### Phase 5: Think Bigger (5-10 min)

Pick 2-3 life-shaper questions:

**Resource Allocation:**
- "Is your time going where your values are?"
- "What would the 80/20 version of this week look like?"

**Potential Detection:**
- "Where is there untapped leverage you're ignoring?"
- "What would make this week *outstanding* vs just good?"

**Gratitude:**
- "What are you grateful for from last week?"
- "What's working that you're taking for granted?"

**Edge:**
- "What uncomfortable thing will you do?" (One Brave Act)
- "What will you do purely for aliveness?" (One Joy Anchor)

### Phase 6: Write & Verify (5 min)

Update all files atomically:
1. Create new week journal with Top 3s, pillars, project buckets
2. Complete last week's reflection + one-line summary
3. Update `GLOBAL_STATE.md`
4. Update project `_STATE.md` files
5. Update `TODO.md` "This Week" section
6. Update people notes if anyone was mentioned
7. Note progress in monthly doc

Each week journal includes a **One-Line Summary** for easy monthly rollup.

## Monthly Cadence (60-90 minutes)

Best done the first weekend of each month. This is deep calibration.

### Part 1: The 8 Questions (45 min)

Work through these in your monthly doc (`02_JOURNAL/Monthly/{{year}}-{{month}}.md`):

#### 1. Identity Calibration
- Who did I become this month?
- What traits strengthened?
- What traits weakened?
- Am I closer to or further from who I want to be?

#### 2. Energy Audit
- What gave me energy?
- What drained energy?
- Are there patterns?

#### 3. Truth Inventory
- What am I avoiding?
- What conversation am I postponing?
- What truth am I not telling myself?

#### 4. Relationship Scan
- Who felt closer?
- Who drifted?
- Who do I need to appreciate?
- Who do I need to have a hard conversation with?

#### 5. Creation Review
- What did I create this month?
- Was it important or just urgent?
- What's the ratio?

#### 6. Leverage Check
- Did I build systems or just effort?
- Did I delegate or automate anything?
- What should I stop doing myself?

#### 7. Fear & Edge Detection
- Where did I avoid growth?
- What would I do if I weren't afraid?
- Where is my growth edge right now?

#### 8. Wonder Scan
- What gave me awe this month?
- When did I feel most alive?
- What made me curious?

### Part 2: Pillar Scores (15 min)

Rate each pillar 1-10 based on the month:

| Pillar | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Body & Energy | /10 | |
| Spirit & Meaning | /10 | |
| Mind & Clarity | /10 | |
| Love & Relationships | /10 | |
| Self-Time & Joy | /10 | |
| Creation & Craft | /10 | |
| Wealth & Leverage | /10 | |
| Impact & Service | /10 | |
| Media & Personal Brand | /10 | |
| Exploration & Adventure | /10 | |

Look for:
- Any pillar below 5 (needs attention)
- Any pillar below 3 (crisis mode)
- Patterns over time (trending down?)

### Part 3: Next Month Focus (15 min)

Based on your review:

1. **Which 2-3 pillars need focus?**
2. **What's one thing to start?**
3. **What's one thing to stop?**
4. **What's one thing to continue?**

Update `00_SYSTEM/GLOBAL_STATE.md` with your monthly insights.

## Quarterly Cadence (2-3 hours)

Every three months, zoom out and assess the bigger picture.

### Review Quarter (60 min)

1. **Goal Review** - Look at your quarterly goals in `01_GOALS/`
   - What did you achieve?
   - What fell short? Why?
   - What surprised you?

2. **Project Assessment** - Review each project in `03_PROJECTS/`
   - Is this still worth doing?
   - Is it in the right phase?
   - Should it be paused, accelerated, or killed?

3. **Relationship Audit** - Scan `04_PEOPLE/`
   - Who have you neglected?
   - Who's become more important?
   - Any relationships to intentionally end?

### Plan Quarter (60 min)

1. **Set 2-3 Quarterly Goals**
   - Derived from your yearly goals
   - Specific and measurable
   - Connected to your identity

2. **Adjust Yearly Targets**
   - Based on reality (not fantasy)
   - What needs to change?

3. **Project Portfolio**
   - What's the priority order?
   - Any new projects to add?
   - Any to archive?

### Archive & Clean (30 min)

1. Move completed projects to `06_ARCHIVE/`
2. Clean up any stale notes
3. Update all `_STATE.md` files
4. Commit everything with a clear message

## Yearly Cadence (Half day)

A dedicated `/yearly` skill is planned; for now use this as a manual ritual.

January is vision refresh time. This is the deepest work.

### Part 1: Year in Review (90 min)

Look back at the entire year:

1. **What were my biggest wins?**
2. **What were my biggest failures?**
3. **What did I learn about myself?**
4. **Who had the biggest impact on me?**
5. **What would I do differently?**

### Part 2: Vision Refresh (60 min)

Update `00_SYSTEM/LIFE_VISION.md`:

1. Re-write your 5-year vision from scratch
2. What changed?
3. What stayed the same?
4. Archive the old version in `LIFE_VISION_ARCHIVE.md`

### Part 3: Year Planning (90 min)

Create `01_GOALS/{{year}}.md`:

1. **Theme** - What word defines this year?
2. **Big 3** - Three transformational goals
3. **Pillar Intentions** - One focus per pillar
4. **Projects** - What will you build?
5. **Anti-goals** - What will you NOT do?

### Part 4: Setup (30 min)

1. Archive last year's weekly/monthly docs
2. Create Q1 goals
3. Create January monthly doc
4. Create Week 1 doc
5. Update `GLOBAL_STATE.md`
6. Commit with "Year {{year}} initialized"

## Tips for Success

### Start Small

- Week 1: Just do daily check-ins
- Week 2: Add weekly planning
- Month 2: Add monthly reflection
- Then add quarterly and yearly

### Don't Force It

- Skip a day? Don't guilt yourself
- Miss a week? Pick up next week
- The system is here to serve you, not the other way around

### Use Claude

- Ask Claude to help with weekly reviews
- Have Claude prompt you through monthly questions
- Let Claude help you see patterns

### Track Progress

- Git history shows your evolution
- Monthly pillar scores reveal trends
- Yearly archives show transformation

### Adjust the Cadences

- Daily too much? Do it every other day
- Weekly too heavy? Simplify to 15 minutes
- Monthly too infrequent? Try bi-weekly deep dives

The cadences are defaults. Make them yours.
