# Weekly Review Playbook

A structured process for closing the past week with pattern insights and setting up the next with clarity.

## When

**Saturday evening, Sunday, or Monday morning** — Flexible by design. Pick what works.

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Philosophy

- **Don't ask what you know** — Read the data, surface patterns, confirm accuracy
- **Project-first** — Top 3s emerge from project review, not abstract thinking
- **Think bigger** — This isn't task management, it's life alignment
- **Zero entropy** — Every mentioned entity gets updated

---

## The Flow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SILENT READ → WEEK PORTRAIT → PROJECTS → TOP 3s → PILLARS →       │
│  THINK BIGGER → FULL RECAP → WRITE → VERIFY                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Part 1: Week Portrait (10 min)

Close last week with **patterns**, not just lists.

### 1. Read Last Week

Open `02_JOURNAL/Weekly/YYYY-W##.md` and scan:
- Daily entries (energy levels, notes)
- Completed/incomplete tasks
- Pillar tracking grid
- Gratitude entries

### 2. Draw the Portrait

**Energy Arc:** How did energy flow?
> "Started 8 → dipped to 5 midweek → recovered to 7"

**Pillar Heat Map:** Which pillars got love? Which were neglected?
```
████████░░ Creation (8 days)
███░░░░░░░ Body (3 days)
░░░░░░░░░░ Wealth (0 days) ⚠️
```

**Project Distribution:** Where did focus actually go?
- Project A: 60%
- Project B: 25%
- Scattered: 15%

**Top Win:** What shipped or succeeded?

**Top Gap:** What didn't happen that should have?

**Pattern:** One insight about the week's rhythm.
> "Front-loaded work, coasted by Thursday"

### 3. Confirm

Ask yourself: "Is this accurate? Anything missing?"

---

## Part 2: Project-by-Project (10 min)

### For Each Active Project

**Surface what happened:**
- What shipped?
- What's in progress?
- Any decisions made?
- Any blockers?

**Ask two questions:**
1. "What MUST happen for this project this week?"
2. "What would feel like a win?"

### Portfolio Check

- Any projects to add?
- Any to pause or deprioritize?
- Any zombie projects to kill or commit to?

---

## Part 3: Top 3s (5 min)

**Top 3s emerge from the project review.**

### Top 3 Professional

Synthesize from your project "must happens":
1. Highest leverage deliverable
2. Second priority
3. Third priority

### Top 3 Personal

Connect to pillar gaps and monthly focus:
1. Pillar-related or life priority
2. Pillar-related or life priority
3. Pillar-related or life priority

---

## Part 4: Pillar Commitments (5 min)

**Don't walk through all 10. Focus on what needs attention.**

### Score Last Week

| Pillar | Score | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Body | /10 | ↑↓→ |
| Spirit | /10 | ↑↓→ |
| Mind | /10 | ↑↓→ |
| Relationships | /10 | ↑↓→ |
| Joy | /10 | ↑↓→ |
| Creation | /10 | ↑↓→ |
| Wealth | /10 | ↑↓→ |
| Impact | /10 | ↑↓→ |
| Media | /10 | ↑↓→ |
| Exploration | /10 | ↑↓→ |

### Attention Protocol

- **Below 5:** Needs specific commitment this week
- **Below 3:** Crisis mode — prioritize it
- **Above 7:** Keep doing what's working
- **Multi-week low:** Something structural needs to change

### Set Commitments

For weak pillars, set **specific, measurable** commitments:
- "3x gym" not "exercise more"
- "Invoice 2 clients" not "focus on wealth"
- "1x date night" not "be more present"

---

## Part 5: Think Bigger (5-10 min)

This is where task management becomes life alignment.

### Pick 2-3 Questions

**Resource Allocation:**
- Is your time going where your values are?
- What would the 80/20 version of this week look like?
- If you could only do ONE thing, what would matter most?

**Potential Detection:**
- Where is there untapped leverage you're ignoring?
- What would make this week *outstanding* vs just good?
- What are you holding back on that you should go all-in on?

**Vision Alignment:**
- Is this week moving you toward your identity or just moving?
- In 5 years, will this week have mattered?

**Gratitude:**
- What are you grateful for from last week?
- What's working that you're taking for granted?
- Who deserves your appreciation?

**Edge & Growth:**
- What uncomfortable thing will you do? (One Brave Act)
- What will you do purely for aliveness? (One Joy Anchor)

---

## Part 6: Write (5 min)

### Create New Week Journal

`02_JOURNAL/Weekly/YYYY-W##.md` with:
- Week Summary (one-line + month connection)
- Keystone Focus
- Top 3 Personal & Professional
- Pillar Commitments (tracking grid)
- One Brave Act + One Joy Anchor
- Project Buckets with tasks
- Daily Log sections (7 days)
- Empty reflection section

### Complete Last Week's Reflection

Fill in the Week Portrait + pillar scores + one-line summary.

### Update System Files

- `GLOBAL_STATE.md` — Current focus, energy
- `TODO.md` — Sync "This Week" with project buckets
- Project `_STATE.md` files — If anything changed
- People notes — If anyone was mentioned
- Monthly doc — Week progress note

---

## Checklist

Your weekly setup should have:

- [ ] Week Portrait complete (last week closed)
- [ ] One-Line Summary for rollup
- [ ] Keystone focus defined
- [ ] Top 3 Personal set
- [ ] Top 3 Professional set
- [ ] Pillar commitments (focus on gaps)
- [ ] One Brave Act named
- [ ] One Joy Anchor planned
- [ ] Project buckets with tasks
- [ ] Month connection noted
- [ ] All state files updated

---

## Tips

### Protect the Time
Block this on your calendar. It's not optional.

### Don't Over-Plan
Leave slack. 70% planned is about right.

### Month Connection
Your keystone should serve your monthly focus. If it doesn't, one of them is wrong.

### Patterns Over Tasks
The Week Portrait matters more than listing every item. See the forest.

### One-Line Summary
This makes monthly rollups trivial. Capture the week's essence for future scanning.

### Project-First
Top 3s feel more real when they emerge from project reality, not abstract thinking.

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Skipping the Portrait
The pattern recognition is the value. Don't just list tasks.

### Planning Too Much
If it doesn't fit on one page, it's too much.

### Ignoring Low Pillars
Multiple weeks below 5 = structural problem. Address it.

### Asking What You Know
If you have the data, surface the patterns. Only ask to confirm or fill gaps.

### Forgetting Joy
Productivity without aliveness leads to burnout. Schedule the joy anchor.

### Disconnecting from Month
Every week should explicitly serve monthly goals. If it doesn't, realign.
