# Pulse Log

Quick health checks over time. Each `/scan` appends an entry below.

## What This Tracks

**Cascade Status:** How well each level connects to the one above it.
- Vision → Life → Year → Month → Week → Projects
- Status: Aligned | Partial | Broken | Missing

**Freshness:** How stale your key files are.

**Attention vs Intention:** Where energy flows vs stated priorities.

## Use This Log To

- Spot recurring cascade breaks (are you always disconnected at the same level?)
- Track freshness patterns (what keeps going stale?)
- See which challenges keep appearing (what are you avoiding?)
- Notice if actions get completed (are you following through?)
