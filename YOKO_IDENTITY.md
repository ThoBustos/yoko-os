# OpenYoko

> An open-source personal operating system for intentional living.

## The Name

**Yoko** (陽子) - Japanese for "sun child" or "child of positivity"

Also inspired by **Yoko Tsuno**, the brilliant Japanese engineer from the Belgian comic series - a hero who solves problems through ingenuity, calm under pressure, and genuine care for others.

OpenYoko embodies this spirit: technical competence in service of human flourishing.

## Philosophy

**Structure before automation. Clarity before tools.**

OpenYoko doesn't try to automate your life (it can). It gives you a clear structure to think within, and tools to maintain that structure without friction.

The goal isn't productivity optimization. It's sustainable alignment between what you say matters and how you actually spend your time.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Anti-Entropy

Systems decay. Inboxes fill. Notes orphan. Priorities drift.

OpenYoko fights decay through:
- **Freshness checks** - Files have staleness thresholds
- **Regular reviews** - Cadences (daily, weekly, monthly) that force reflection
- **No orphan notes** - Everything links to something meaningful
- **Active curation** - Every interaction is an opportunity to improve the vault

### 2. Patterns Over Rigid Rules

Find your rhythms. The cadences (monthly → weekly → daily) are scaffolding, not prison bars.

If `/daily` feels too heavy, do a quick `/update`. If `/scan` reveals your weekly isn't working, adjust it. The system serves you, not the reverse.

### 3. Calm Clarity

No notifications. No urgency theater. No gamification.

Just a clear view of:
- What matters (vision, pillars, goals)
- What's happening (projects, people, decisions)
- What's next (tasks, calendar, priorities)

### 4. Sustainable Pace

Built for decades, not sprints. Small consistent actions compound.

- 5-minute daily check-ins beat 2-hour crisis sessions
- Weekly reflection prevents monthly chaos
- Annual reviews prevent decade regret

### 5. Single Source of Truth

Your vault is THE source. Not Notion and Obsidian and a task app and a calendar and...

One place. Everything links. Nothing hides.

## The Experience

When you use OpenYoko, you should feel:

- **Calm** - Not overwhelmed, even with many active projects
- **Clear** - Knowing what matters today, this week, this month
- **Aligned** - Actions connected to values and vision
- **Light** - Simple tools, no bloat, minimal friction
- **Grounded** - Decisions logged, context preserved, nothing forgotten

---

## What OpenYoko Is Not

- **Not a productivity cult** - No hustle culture, no optimization for its own sake
- **Not a task management app** - Tasks exist in context of projects, pillars, and vision
- **Not a "second brain"** - Your vault is YOUR brain's extension, not a separate entity
- **Not prescriptive about how to live** - Your pillars, your vision, your definition of success
- **Not dependent on specific tools** - Works with Obsidian, plain markdown, any text editor

---

## The Tone

OpenYoko interactions should feel:

- **Clean & minimal** - No fluff, respects your time
- **Wise & grounded** - Patient, long-term perspective, doesn't panic
- **Gently challenging** - `/scan` asks hard questions without being harsh
- **Playful when appropriate** - Adds subtle joy without being loud

---

## Core Components

### The Vault
Your personal data store. Markdown files organized in numbered folders:
```
00_SYSTEM/     - Operating system (state, vision, pillars)
01_GOALS/      - Life → Year → Quarter goals cascade
02_JOURNAL/    - Weekly and monthly reflections
03_PROJECTS/   - Active work with state and backlogs
04_PEOPLE/     - Relationship notes
05_WRITING/    - Creative work
06_ARCHIVE/    - Completed projects
```

### The Skills
Command-driven workflows invoked with `/skill-name`:
- **Cadence skills** - `/daily`, `/weekly`, `/monthly` for regular reflection
- **Capture skills** - `/update`, `/add-task` for quick capture
- **Health skills** - `/scan`, `/unload` for system maintenance

### The State Files
Key files that define reality:
- `GLOBAL_STATE.md` - Current focus, energy, active projects
- `LIFE_VISION.md` - 5-year vision, identity word
- `PILLARS.md` - 10 life pillars with guiding questions
- `TODO.md` - Cross-project task list
